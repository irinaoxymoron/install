    <div class="content__title" id="aboutTitle">Let me introduce myself</div>
    <p class="content__text" id="aboutText">It is accepted that a designer and a web developer are two
        different specialties. To be honest, I have a different point of view. A good
        UX-specialist should know the basics of programming, should be able to analyze,
        must constantly develop and learn something new. I think that it is very inspiring
        to work! Now I would like to work in a long-term project with interesting
        new tasks. I hope that my skills can be interesting for your company.
