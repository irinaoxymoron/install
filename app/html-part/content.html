        <p class="content__text" data-id="aboutText">It is accepted that a designer and a web developer are two
            different specialties. To be honest, I have a different point of view. A good
            UX-specialist should know the basics of programming, should be able to analyze,
            must constantly grow and learn something new. And I think that it is very inspiring
            to work! And now I would like to work in a long-term project with interesting
            new tasks. I hope that my skills can be interesting for your company.
